# VT-CS-Resume-Database
This repo contains our Senior Capstone project for Software Engineering. The goal of this projet is to build an application to connect recruiters with students by allowing students to upload their resumes and list their skills, class, and what type of work they are looking for. Recruiters can search by any of these fields.

## How to run:
In the `/backend` directory, run the command `python3 manage.py runserver`. This will spin up the backend.  
To spin up the frontend for recruiters, navigate to the `/frontend/recruiters` directory. If this is your first time running the code, first run `npm i` to install the necessary packages. To spin up the recruiter frontend, type `npm start`.  
To spin up the frontend for students and admins, perform the same steps as listed above, except in the `/frontend/resumeapp` directory.
